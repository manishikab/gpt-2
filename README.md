# GPT2 From Scratch Timeline and Steps

## Week 1
- Introduce Project
- Introduce PyTorch

## Week 2
- Explain transformer architecture
- Implement gpt2.py (Overall structure)

## Week 3
- Explain Tokenization, Positional Encoding, Self Attention
- Implement Block, MLP, Attention python files
- Test of pretrained_gpt2.py

## Week 4
- Write DataLoader for traning on actual datasets
- Train on mini dataset (write train_gpt2_shakespeare.py)
    - Will need to edit forward function to include loss
    - Will need to add weight sharing scheme
